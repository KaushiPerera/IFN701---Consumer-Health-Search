

A

1) The use of query recommendations, increases the number of successful queries; 

2) The impact of query recommendations on successfully completing a predefined health search task and the overall user satisfaction is not significant; 

3) Query suggestions provided by the Health Information Query Assistant system are beneficial for consumers when searching health related information 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

B

1) Behavioural synonym mapping is the best performing synonym mapping because users are more likely to correctly answer questions with the use of results retrieved using queries clarified with Behavioural mapping.; 

2) Behavioural mapping is the least preferred mapping for incorrectly answered questions;

3) Lay people prefer query clarifications more than experts because lay people are able to retrieve  more useful information to correctly answer health-related questions; 

4) Experts prefer to have their own original queries when retrieving information; 

5) The difference in success rates between lay people and experts is not significant; 

6) There is a strong correlation of the success rate of each question between the lay people's group and the experts' group because some questions were more difficult for both groups when compared to other questions; 

7) The number of correctly answered medical questions increased with the trustworthiness of the web pages used to answer the question; 

8) Clarified queries are able to retrieve more trustworthy resources as results; 

9) The 'simple multinomial logistic regression classifier' performs the best when compared to all individual synonym mappings and unclarified queries; 

10) The clarification process can be further improved by selecting the most appropriate query clarification method (synonym mapping) to clarify each query; 

11) Implicit query clarifications are highly useful, and does not require users to be aware of the correct medical terminology.
